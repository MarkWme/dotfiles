# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles that I have and which is mine, and what it is too.

They probably wont work for you, as they expect stuff in certain places. There are many, many better put together dotfiles repos out there. Go use one of them instead.

Meanwhile, this is a work in progress which I pretty much setup to capture some configs I've been tweaking before I inadvertently do something stupid and wipe them out. 

Support so far:

* Config for i3
* Config for polybar
